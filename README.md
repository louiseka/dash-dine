# Jimmy's Diner

## Description

### What is Jimmy's Diner?

Jimmy's Diner is an app that allows customers to order online. Customers can easily add items to their order and pay for the total at checkout. If a customer accidentally adds an item to their order, they can simply remove it. This project was completed as part of Scrimba's Frontend Career Path.

### Technologies Used

I have used JavaScript for this project, because: 

- I was able to build an interactive menu and checkout process
- The total order can be calculated
- Use of a flexible data set for menu items

## Implementations for future

- Have quantities of food items added to checkout
- A message that says 'Item added to cart/ removed from cart'
- A11y checks for colour contrasts and form elements
- Customisation to items on the menu
- Mobile responsiveness
