# Dash and Dine

## Description

Dash and Dine is an app that allows customers to order online. Customers can easily add items to their order and pay for the total at checkout. If a customer accidentally adds an item to their order, they can simply remove it. 

### Technologies Used

I orginally used JavaScript for this project, but has now been updated to TypeScript: 

- I was able to build an interactive menu and checkout process
- The total order can be calculated
- Use of a flexible data set for menu items

## Implementations for future

- ~~Update to TypeScript~~
- ~~A11y checks for colour contrasts and form elements~~
- Customisation to items on the menu
- ~~Mobile responsiveness~~
- ~~Have quantities of food items added to checkout~~
